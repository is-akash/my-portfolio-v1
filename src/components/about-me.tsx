                    In 2022, I discovered my passion for coding after seeing my
                    friend code. âœ¨ I love using my creativity to build things
                    for the web. Being self-taught was challenging, but I'm
                    motivated by the excitement of learning new things and
                    overcoming unfamiliar challenges. ðŸ“š As a software engineer,
                    I combine technical expertise with a keen design sense to
                    create scalable, efficient, and visually appealing
                    applications. My aim is to deliver engaging, pixel-perfect
                    user experiences. ðŸš€
